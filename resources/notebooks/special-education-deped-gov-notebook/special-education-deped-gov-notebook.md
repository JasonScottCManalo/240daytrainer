# Special Education Notebook


The duration of education for special education (SPED) learners varies depending on the individual's needs, abilities, and the education system of their country. However, in general:

1. **Early Intervention (ages 0–5)**: Many special education programs offer early intervention services for children with developmental delays or disabilities from birth until they enter kindergarten.

2. **Primary and Secondary Education (ages 5–18)**: Special education students typically follow a similar structure to general education but with individualized education plans (IEPs) that tailor the curriculum to their needs. This can last through elementary, middle, and high school, typically until the age of 18, though it may extend longer based on individual progress.

3. **Post-Secondary Transition (ages 18–21 or older)**: In many countries, students with disabilities may continue their education until the age of 21. This period focuses on life skills, vocational training, or transition services that help students prepare for adulthood.

Some students may continue their education through alternative programs or transition into specialized services depending on their needs. Ultimately, the timeline depends on the student’s progress and their educational goals.
